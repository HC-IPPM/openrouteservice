# OpenRouteService (ORS) UI and API

This repository contains a custom deployment of OpenRouteService (ORS) and a frontend UI for interacting with the ORS API. The setup allows users to utilize various geographic and routing services provided by ORS. Currently, the service is configured to work for Canada.

## Overview

OpenRouteService (ORS) is a highly customizable, performant routing service written in Java. It uses a forked and edited version of GraphHopper to provide global spatial services by consuming user-generated and collaboratively collected free geographic data directly from OpenStreetMap.

### Features of ORS

- **Directions Service**: Get directions for different modes of transport.
- **Isochrones Service**: Obtain areas of reachability from given locations.
- **Matrix Service**: Obtain one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many matrices for time and distance.
- **Snapping Service**: Snap coordinates to the road network.
- **Export Service**: Export the base graph for different modes of transport (not available in the public API).
- **Health Endpoint**: Get information on the health of the running ORS instance.
- **Status Endpoint**: Get information on the status of the ORS instance.

## Available Endpoints

### Directions

Retrieve directions between specified start and end points.

- **Endpoint**: `/ors/v2/directions/{profile}`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "coordinates": [
      [longitude1, latitude1],
      [longitude2, latitude2]
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Profiles**: `driving-car`, `foot-walking`, `wheelchair`, etc.

### Isochrones

Generate isochrones (areas of reachability) from a given location.

- **Endpoint**: `/ors/v2/isochrones/{profile}`

### Matrix

Calculate a matrix of distances and/or times between multiple points.

- **Endpoint**: `/ors/v2/matrix/{profile}`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "locations": [
      [longitude1, latitude1],
      [longitude2, latitude2]
    ],
    "metrics": ["distance", "duration"]
  }
  ```
- **Profiles**: `driving-car`, `foot-walking`, `wheelchair`, etc.

### Snap

Snap coordinates to the nearest road network.

- **Endpoint**: `/ors/v2/snap/{profile}`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "locations": [
      [longitude, latitude]
    ],
    "radius": radius_in_meters
  }
  ```
- **Profiles**: `driving-car`, `foot-walking`, `wheelchair`, etc.

### Status

Check the status of the ORS instance.

- **Endpoint**: `/ors/v2/status`
- **HTTP Method**: GET

## Usage

### UI Usage

1. **Access the UI**:
   Navigate to `https://ors-sro.alpha.phac-aspc.gc.ca` in your web browser.

2. **Using the Map**:
   - Click on the map to set start and end points for directions.
   - Use the provided forms to generate isochrones, calculate matrix values, and snap coordinates.

### API Usage

You can interact with the ORS API using tools like `curl`, Postman, or directly within your applications.

#### Fetching Directions

```sh
curl -X POST "https://ors-sro.alpha.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ors/v2/directions/driving-car" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "coordinates": [
    [-114.0719, 51.0447],
    [-113.4938, 53.5461]
  ]
}'
```

#### Generating Isochrones

```sh
curl -X POST "https://ors-sro.alpha.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ors/v2/isochrones/driving-car" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "locations": [
    [-114.0719, 51.0447]
  ],
  "range": [600]
}'
```

#### Calculating Matrix

```sh
curl -X POST "https://ors-sro.alpha.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ors/v2/matrix/driving-car" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "locations": [
    [-114.0719, 51.0447],
    [-113.4938, 53.5461]
  ],
  "metrics": ["distance", "duration"]
}'
```

#### Snapping Coordinates

```sh
curl -X POST "https://ors-sro.alpha.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ors/v2/snap/driving-car" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
